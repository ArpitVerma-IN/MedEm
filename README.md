## 📖 Overview

**MedEm** is an advanced minimum viable prototype for evaluating live-tracking infrastructure in large-scale medical applications. 

By pairing blazing-fast **HTML5 Geolocation** directly with **WebSockets**, it enables multiple remote users (Doctors and Patients) to stream their exact cross-global coordinates securely onto a dynamic leaflet map in real-time. 

Recently, MedEm achieved **Phase 1 UI/UX** modernization—boasting entirely independent, mobile-first responsive dashboards tailored explicitly for Patients and Responders using Tailwind CSS v4 and Framer Motion. This major update introduced persistent guest authentication, interactive sub-settings views, dynamic system dark/light theming, modular code-splitting for optimal performance across device capabilities, intelligent lazy loading for heavy component routes, and foundational tracking map enhancements fixing canvas responsiveness.

## ✨ Key Features & Architecture

### 📱 Independent Mobile-First Dashboards
- **Patient Portal:** A calming, deeply-colored indigo ecosystem focused on ease of use. Features a massive central "Medical Care" SOS button, an elastic Live Map that dynamically expands/minimizes, and an intuitive bottom navigation bar.
- **Responder (Doctor) Portal:** A high-contrast emerald interface built for rapid triage. It automatically pulls active SOS signals into a floating targeting console, allowing Doctors to instantly lock onto a patient's exact location.

### 🚑 Emergency Broadcast System (500m Geofence)
- **Role Detection:** Upon login, users distinctly select to join as either a **Patient** or a **Doctor**.
- **Dynamic Alerts:** If a Patient securely declares they `"need medical care!"` and actively enters a **500-meter radius** of a logged-in Doctor, the Doctor's dashboard triggers an emergency state—deploying red banners and aggressively pulsating map markers to draw direct attention to the patient's coordinates.
- **Targeted Rescue Mode:** Doctors can triage patients. By accepting to assist a specific patient from their targeting UI, the system engages *only* that patient. It displays a live decreasing Approach Distance (`e.g., Tracking: 240 m`) for the Doctor, while broadcasting a private `A Doctor is on the way!` slide-up banner to the Patient.
### 🔒 AES-256-CBC End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)
- **Private Medical Communications:** MedEm secures all real-time messaging between victims and responders utilizing a deeply-integrated polymorphic drop-in of the native **NodeJS `crypto` module** safely executing over Vite polyfills across the WebSocket layer. Messages are cryptographically converted into unreadable AES-256-CBC ciphertext securely within the device memory before they even hit the server, ensuring rapid encryption avoiding restrictive browser `window.crypto` contexts. The backend operates identically as a blind relay.

### 🌐 Tripartite Elastic Map Elements & Responsive Architecture
- **Mobile Real-Estate Constraints:** The live Map transitions seamlessly through three states (*Collapsed*, *Mini-Modal*, and *Fullscreen*). It features newly rebuilt layout logic mapping independent Dark Mode/Light Mode toggles directly to CartoDB vector endpoints, minimizing visual strain in nighttime environments.
- **Dynamic Canvases:** The dashboard headers operate on highly responsive flex-driven sticky canvases that seamlessly overlapping under main elements instead of rigid hardcoding, automatically stretching correctly for any future "announcements/alerts" without breaking UI scale or causing z-index component freezing.
- **Aggressive Code-Splitting optimization:** Features massive bundle size minimizations using `React.lazy` and strict `<Suspense>` boundaries. Visitors do not load massive chunk-heavy interactive maps, history logs, or AI verification routes until explicitly invoked, securing lightning-cast initial TTFB (Time To First Byte).

### ⚡ Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** React 19 + TypeScript (Powered by Vite)
- **Aesthetic System:** Tailwind CSS v4 + Framer Motion + Lucide-React SVGs
- **Live Connection Layer:** Socket.IO / WebSockets (Client & Server)
- **Security:** Native Web Crypto API (AES-GCM Encryption)
- **Cartography Engine:** React-Leaflet + Leaflet.js
- **Backend Infrastructure:** Express server running dynamically on Node.js

## 🚀 How to Deploy (Step-by-Step)

Because this web architecture strictly relies on both a persistent WebSockets backend and an SSL-secured frontend UI (which is mandatory for browser Geolocation APIs), this application must be split-deployed across two free cloud providers: **Render** and **Netlify**.

### Step 1: Push Code to GitHub
Ensure this entire repository is successfully uploaded into a remote GitHub repository.

### Step 2: Deploy the Real-Time Backend (`Render.com`)
1. Create a free account at [Render](https://render.com).
2. Go to your Dashboard → Click **New +** → Select **Web Service**.
3. Link your GitHub Repo.
4. Apply the following settings:
    - **Language:** Node
    - **Build Command:** `npm install`
    - **Start Command:** `npm run server`
5. Click **Deploy Web Service** at the bottom.
6. **⚠️ SAVE THE URL:** Once it goes live, safely copy the resulting `.onrender.com` URL (Example: `https://medem-io82.onrender.com`).

### Step 3: Deploy the React Frontend (`Netlify.com`)
1. Create a free account at [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).
2. Click **Add new site** → **Import an existing project**.
3. Select your GitHub Repo.
4. **⚠️ CRITICAL - Add Environment Variable:**
   - Before clicking the final deploy, click `Show advanced` or navigate to environment variables inside the Site config!
   - Under your environments, create a New Variable:
   - **Key:** `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value:** *Paste the exact Render URL you copied in Step 2.*
5. Leave everything else default (Netlify handles `npm run build` natively via the included `netlify.toml`).
6. Click **Deploy Site**.

Once Netlify supplies your live HTTPS URL, send it to any mobile device in the world to begin tracking!

## 💻 Local Developer Mode (Wi-Fi Testing)

If you simply wish to clone and test this locally between an iPhone and your Laptop on a home router:

1. **Terminal 1 (Backend WebSocket Server):**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run server
   ```
2. **Terminal 2 (React Frontend Server):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --host
   ```
*(Note: Using the `--host` flag forcibly exposes Vite to your local area network (LAN).*

3. Find your PC's IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.5`).
4. On your mobile phone, open Safari/Chrome to `http://192.168.1.5:5173`.
